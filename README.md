# BitGraph

BitGraph is a graph library uniquely designed for Bit's purposes.

It features two classes: 

* [Graph](src/abstract-graph/README.md) - an abstract graph that extends GraphLib

* [DependencyGraph](src/dependency-graph/README.md) - extends Graph with specific features for handling dependencies (between components, extensions, etc.)
